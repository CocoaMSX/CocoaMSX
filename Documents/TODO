!!! Fix function key support on the laptop - Fx keys aren't mappable

* Inserting special cartridges doesn't work - try inserting FMPAC
* Don't list special carts not found on the host system
* Don't allow cassette changing while the machine is stopped. I'm currently
  making assumptions when repositioning cassette that this will not be the case

* Add option to create new disk images

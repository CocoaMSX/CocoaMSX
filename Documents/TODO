* Go over Caps Lock - is it being pressed/released correctly in the emulator?

* Inserting special cartridges doesn't work - try inserting FMPAC
* Don't list special carts not found on the host system
* Don't allow cassette changing while the machine is stopped. I'm currently
  making assumptions when repositioning cassette that this will not be the case

* Add option to create new disk images
* Add an option to paste text, and possibly figure out a way to copy 
  (read VRAM?)

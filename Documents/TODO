!!! Fix function key support on the laptop - Fx keys aren't mappable

* Inserting special cartridges doesn't work - try inserting FMPAC
* Use the same dialog as Insert Disk to Insert Folder instead
* Don't list special carts not found on the host system
* Set the file types properly for cassette, disk & cart open dialogs
* Don't allow cassette changing while the machine is stopped. I'm currently 
  making assumptions when repositioning cassette that this will not be the case

* Add option to create new disk images

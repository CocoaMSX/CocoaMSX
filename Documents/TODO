* If there's no internet connectivity, don't download the machine feed, or
  have some way to disable machine feed auto-updates
* Verify MD5 hash

Other:
* Go over Caps Lock - is it being pressed/released correctly in the emulator?
* Change how scanline enabling/disabling is handled - currently clumsy, considering
  that blueMSX can explicitly toggle enable/disable

* Add option to create new disk images
* Add an option to paste text, and possibly figure out a way to copy 
  (read VRAM?)
